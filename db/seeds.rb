    "about": "Hi, my name is Jagger and I am a male, shorthaired bicolor tabby. I had a very scary start in life. My momma was taken by an owl when I was just 3 weeks old. I come from a litter of four - two brothers Jasper and Jack - and my sister Janie. When the owl grabbed momma, his talons got a hold of me. I had to talon punctures that perforated my intestines. A kind lady heard us crying out for hours in a drainage ditch with a storm on the horizon. She grabbed all for four of us just before a huge rain storm. She noticed my wound right away and rushed me to an emergency veterinarian. The wonderful clinic took care of me and even performed free surgery to repair the damage caused by the owl. My foster mommy called Small Lives Matter Kitten Rescue to see if they could help with the vet bills and finding us homes for life. Ugh - what a story, right. We all healthy and happy at the Frisky Cat Cafe. Here is what my foster mommy says about me.\n\"Jagger fought hard for his life. He was half the size of he other kittens in the litter, but he caught up to his siblings very quickly. he is the sweetest baby in the litter. Curious and loving. You will find him woo-ing potential adopters by climbing their shoulders licking their ears. He loves visitors and engages them in the cutest way.\"\nWe have dozens of kittens available!

    #   "about": "Hi my name is Quentessa. I am a young adult female mix tabby with dark mackerel swirls and leopard spots. My brother, Quentin and I were dropped off at the shelter because our owners no longer wanted us. We are both very good cats and I am not sure why our owners did not want us any more. I am gregarious and outgoing! I have never met a cat, kitten or person that I did not like. I love to play with the visitors that come to the cafe. I can climb up and down the climbing wall showing everyone what a great, confident at I am. Even though, I have fun at the cafe, I would love to find a family that would love me and give me a home for life.\nCome and meet Quentessa. All of our adoptable cats are located at the Frisky Cat Cafe in St Augustine. 1092 Ponce De Leon Blvd (US 1). Stop in for a visit."

    #   "about": "Ariana is a strikingly beautiful, small black young adult. She was the mother of a litter of 5 kittens at just 7 months old. She was a great momma cat, but was starving and a mere 3 and half pounds. She saved her babies and lived! She is a sweet miracle. Ariana has been at the cafe for too long. She wants to be with a person or family to love. She is a sweet, loving, endearing soul. She has majestic beauty and is so overlooked because she is black. Black cats are wonderful cats and they are overlooked by so many adopters. Ariana gives love tens times the amount given to her. She is sensitive to humans and is extremely affectionate. Please take a chance on this wonderful girl!\nAll of our adoptable cats are located at the Frisky Cat Cafe in St Augustine. 1092 Ponce De Leon Blvd (US 1). Stop in for a visit."

    #   "about": "Esme is a female all black kitten. Her fur is on the longer side and is very soft, not coarse like some of the shiny black kittens.\nEsme came from a litter of four and they were feral kittens. Her litter mates settled in and became people loving snuggle kittens. They have all been adopted. Esme is quiet and gets along with everyone, but is still a little on the wild side. She was shy at first, but has settled in and made some friends. She is now outgoing and loves to play with visitors. She is not a lap kitty and will tolerate being held yet. Esme would be a great indoor/outdoor cat or even a good mouser, if you need one.\nAll of our adoptable cats are located at the Frisky Cat Cafe in St Augustine. 1092 Ponce De Leon Blvd (US 1).
